# Interactive Navigation Menu

This project is a simple and clean **interactive navigation menu** built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a fixed navbar that changes style upon scrolling and links to different sections of the page.

## 🚀 Features

* Fixed navigation bar with smooth scrolling
* Stylish and responsive design
* Scroll-based navbar background color change
* Four sections: Home, Services, About, and Contact
* Optimized for various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3 (with media queries for responsiveness)
* JavaScript (scroll event listener)

## 📁 Project Structure

```

```

## 🧾 How It Works

* The **navbar** is fixed at the top and uses JavaScript to detect scroll position.
* When the user scrolls down 50px or more, a `.scrolled` class is added to the navbar, changing its background.
* Each menu item links to a section (`#home`, `#services`, `#about`, `#contact`) with a full-screen layout.
* CSS media queries handle responsiveness for different devices.
