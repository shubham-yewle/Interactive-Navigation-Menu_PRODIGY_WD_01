* Scroll-based navbar background color change

## 📁 Project Structure

* How It Works

* The navbar is fixed at the top and uses JavaScript to detect scroll position.
* When the user scrolls down 50px or more, a .scrolled` class is added to the navbar, changing its background.
* Each menu item links to a section (#home, #services, #about, #contact) with a full-screen layout.
* CSS media queries handle responsiveness for different devices.
